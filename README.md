A 2D Unity game where you watch birds. Compatible with PC, Android, and iOS. 

There are 3 main game mechanics;
1. Bird Watching - toggle binocular view and carefully ID the bird infront of you to add it to your bird card deck
2. Card Battling - compete with other bird watchers in town with your bird card deck
3. Story and NPC Interaction - interact with other townsfolk and uncover the story of the son

This is a solo project which will include original code, pixel art, and music.
